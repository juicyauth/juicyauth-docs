### JWT Verification Backend Prompt

You can use this prompt in ChatGPT or Gemini to get help with implementing JWT handling in your backend.

---

**Prompt:**

I need help implementing JWT verification in my backend using this API endpoint:  
`GET https://api.juicyauth.dev/auth/public-key/` to retrieve the public key used to verify JWTs issued by the JuicyAuth service. The tokens are encoded using the RS256 algorithm.

Can you provide an implementation example in [your chosen backend technology]?

Also, please give me an example of a public route and a protected route that requires a valid token for access.

**Important:** Remember to replace `[your chosen backend technology]` with the specific technology you're using (e.g., Node.js, Python/FastAPI).
