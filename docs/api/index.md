# API Overview

Lockless provides a set of secure endpoints for OTP-based authentication. These APIs are designed to integrate seamlessly with your backend services.

The authentication process involves:

1. **Sending an OTP** (One-Time Password) to the user's email.
2. **Verifying the OTP** to authenticate the user.
3. **Retrieving the public key** for JWT verification (backend only).

Follow the individual sections to understand how to use each endpoint effectively.
