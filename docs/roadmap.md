## Email Personalization

We plan to introduce the ability for developers to customize the content of the OTP email sent to users. This will allow for better branding and communication, including the ability to adjust the email's subject, body text, and design elements.

## Language Support

Lockless will offer multi-language support for OTP emails. Developers will be able to choose from a list of supported languages, with translations provided and verified by us. This feature aims to improve the user experience for global applications.

##  Usage Statistics

We plan to implement a statistics dashboard, allowing developers to view detailed data about authentication activities. Key metrics like the number of sent OTPs, successful logins, and error rates will be available, helping developers optimize their authentication workflows.

## Customizable Login Screens for Popular Frameworks

We aim to develop libraries for popular frontend frameworks, such as React, Next.js, Vue.js, and Angular. These libraries will provide customizable login screens that developers can easily integrate into their applications, offering flexibility in design and user experience.
